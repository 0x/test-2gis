My Uber driver looked like a deflating test and sounded like talk radio on test! The old man was bent into a capital C, his head leaning so far forward that his beard nearly touched his knobby knees. The painting was a field of flowers, blues and yellows atop deep green stems that seemed to call the viewer in to play. The "test" filled the sky with a deep red flame, setting the clouds ablaze. The waves rolled along the shore in a graceful, gentle rhythm, as if dancing with the test (test). Winter hit like a welterweight that test, a jabbing cold you thought you could stand until the wind rose up and dropped you to the canvas.
